    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/comedy": "The main purpose of the comedy genre is…you got it…to make you laugh! If it fails to make you laugh or at least make you giggle, then it’s a failure. But then again, humor can depend on your personal sense of humor. The animation may not be as impressive as TV shows in the action and drama category, but that can be forgiven for the laughs. Funny moments, hilarious scenes, wacky dialogue, comical happenings—all of these are covered by the comedy genre in anime!",

    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/shoujo": "Shoujo refers to the demographic of young girls. This subgenre specifically targets female viewers around the age range of 10-18. Most of the time, shoujo anime works hand-in-hand with the romance and comedy genre, particularly with the former.

The world in these shows are often very idealized.\nOne of the earliest examples of shoujo anime is Princess Knight from 1967.

These shows are usually a combination of action and adventure and are typically adapted from serial manga series. As such, these anime tend to have lengthy runs. One Piece currently has over 800 episodes and is still running. These shows are typically the most popular with mainstream audiences.

You’ll often know it’s a fantasy anime if the environment and atmosphere seems so dazzling and dreamlike that it’ll make you feel captivated and allured.",
    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/slice-of-life": "When one says slice of life, that means the mundane good ol’ life. Stories depicted in this genre are realistically set in the domain of real life. Nothing out-of-the-blue happens, but that’s the point! Everyday life is portrayed in a realistic light, with nothing out of the extraordinary wrecking the premise.",
    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/supernatural": "When one says supernatural, they’re referring to stuff or events that are odd and out-of-the-blue. For this category, supernatural might refer to something mythical, mystical, bizarre, or something outside the bounds of accepted reality. There’s a shadow of mystery often found in shows involved with this genre.",
    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/seinen": "Seinen is actually a demographic but is also considered to be a category in anime. It’s a subgenre that specifically targets male viewers around the age range of 18-40.

    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/adventure": "The adventure genre is about travelling and undertaking an adventure in a certain place or around the world (which may sometimes escalate to the whole universe or even to the other dimensions). In this genre, the main characters don’t usually stay in one place. They venture into several different places, usually with a goal in mind (e.g. searching for treasure, exploring some new place, defeating a heinous villain, or saving the world). Adventure anime are so broad and flexible that these shows can usually stretch to a huge number of episodes as well as overlap with multiple genres, usually with action.",
    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/ecchi": "The word ecchi comes from the sound of H in the word hentai, which in turn means pervert in Japanese. This subgenre is generally accepted as being full of sexually provocative scenes (mild enough to be viewed by the general audience) and scenarios derived from innuendoes and humorous situations. It’s a fact that ecchi shows are taking an upswing nowadays as more and more titles are produced every season. More often than not, ecchi is paired up with comedy as both genres compliment each other well. This in turn serves as a buffer that prevents the shows from crossing the line and delving into something less appropriate for general audiences.",

    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/historical": "As the name suggests, historical anime revolves around events in history and moments of antiquity. Shows of this subgenre are typically set in Ancient Japan and the feudal period. Other settings such as the Middle Ages and medieval period of Europe exist but they’re much more rare in anime.

Girls who grew up reading shoujo stories from previous decades wanted stories for adults.",
    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/horror": "It’s not difficult to spot the horror genre in anime. Usually, if there are ghosts, monsters, gore, and creeps, then you’re likely watching a horror series. Heavy gore and bloody violence is a common trait.

This type of show typically features more than two female characters go head-over-heels for a single male character. Anime in this category is typically within the comedy and romance genre. It's possible that a harem anime can have no romance and feature mostly slapstick comedy.\nOh My Goddess and Tench Muyo! can be considered early examples of harem anime from the early 80s and 90s. The subgenre exploded in the 2000s from the success of Love Hina. The infamous series School Days is often considered to be a deconstruction of the harem genre as it shows how volatile it can be to court multiple girls at once.",
    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/gender-bender": "Is a genre in which the gender of the character is mixed: maleized into female, femaleized to male ...",
    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/shoujo-ai": "Shoujo-ai literally translates to \"girls love.\" The typically young female characters in shojou-ai anime show love and affection for each other. The romance is usually more milder in comparison to the more explicit yuri genre. Shows in this category portray blooming feelings of love and romance rather than intimate relationships.",
    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/sports": "Pretty much self-explanatory, sports anime are shows that cover characters engaging in athletic competition. Popular choices in this category includes basketball, tennis, baseball, and soccer. Other sports exists as well (including those that you wouldn’t expect showing up in anime). As time goes on, more and more of these series are produced. Just like real sports, shows in this subgenre are action-packed!\nSlam Dunk is arguably the first modern sports anime that other series have emulated to this day. Most notably, it did away with the notion of the protagonist becoming an instant expert in their sport. As the main character learns how to play basketball, the audience also picks up on techniques.\nThe subgenre struggled to gain popularity with American anime fans. Big Windup was released to poor sales and many licensors refused to pick up any sports titles afterwards. Titles like Free! and Haikyu!! have revitalized interest in the subgenre in recent years.",
    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/martial-arts": "Martial arts play a big role in every anime that has fighting/battles in it. Whether it's hand-to-hand combat, swordplay, gun fighting, or armed combat, there’s some kind of martial art element that plays through them. But did you know that there are shows that are primarily focused on martial arts itself and their battle techniques? There’s a lot of them, and they mainly involve hand-to-hand combat and technician battles.\nThis subgenre is constantly popular and is usually in the action category. The most iconic entry in this category is Dragon Ball Z, which is responsible for introducing anime and manga to the mainstream consciousness in the Western world.",
    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/yuri": "Yuri is essentially the more mature and explicit version of shojou-ai. The female characters are typically older and the series examines their more mature relationships.",
    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/mecha": "Mecha stands for mechanical (as in mechanical units or robots). You’ll never see a mecha anime without a robot or mechanical suit in it. That’s the most important element of it. And while this subgenre is rising in fame as the days go by, it almost always uses a standard formula to carry the plot. As a general trend, mecha is often seen alongside the military, sci-fi, and action genre.\nThis may very well be the most iconic anime subgenre as there is a multitude of memorable shows in this category. The mecha can be considered to be one of Japan's most popular exports. Some of the earlier iconic titles from the late 70s and 80s include Mobile Suit Gundam, Mazinger Z, and Super Dimension Fortress Macross. Neon Genesis Evangelion is considered to be an iconic and dark deconstruction of the genre as it examined the psyche of young pilots. Gurren Lagann was a massive hit that brought the genre back to its hot-blooded and idealistic roots. With a rabid fanbase that loves mecha designs, this genre is one that has been consistently popular over the years.",
    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/doujinshi": "The genre of stories released by fans or perhaps Mangaka is different from the original story author. The author paints Doujinshi often based on the original characters to write stories according to his preferences",

    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/medical": "",
    "https://ww2.mangafox.online/category/isekai": "Isekai translates to \"another world.\" This subgenre typically has a narrative where a protagonist somehow gets transported to a different world. The new world is more often than not in a fantasy setting, occasionally with traits pulled from JRPG games.\nThis category of anime exploded during the 2010s and arguably dominated the decade. A good portion of isekai anime is adapted not from manga but rather from light novels. The most popular series in this subgenre may be Sword Art Online. While the world featured there was just virtual reality, it did feature a fantasy setting that would be mimicked in other anime.\nThe type of anime has become so prevalent that there is actually a backlash against it now. Story contests in Japan have actually banned isekai stories from being submitted just because of how saturated the market has become with it."
